## Description

Welcome to this super duper application which will definitively revolutionize reality as we know it. 
This is the result of great effort and years of sweat, blood and tears from the three musketeers for the node 2 evaluation at IT-Akademy during the week of 12/11/2018 to 15/11/2018. 

The subject of this evaluation can be found here : https://gitlab.rixo.fr/akad/node2-2018-eval

## Installation 

First step : First install node and npm. 
Second step : Then clone this repo and in the root directory of your clone launch in a terminal "npm install". 
Third step : Everything is all setup 'Tada!'


## Walkthrough 

Exercise 2 : Open a command line, go to the root of the project and launch "node time-server.js" and enjoy the result at "http://localhost:4000"

Exercise 3 : Open a command line, go to the root of the project and launch "node secret-server.js" and enjoy the result at "http://localhost:4001"

Exercise 4 : Do what you did for Exercise 2 and Exercise 3 in their own command line, and keep those command lines open. 
Open a new command line, go to the root of the project and launch "node  sechisrv.js" and enjoy the result at "http://localhost:4000/:id"
